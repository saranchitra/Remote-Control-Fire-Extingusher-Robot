Fire disasters can occur anytime and result in high losses. It is often that fire fighters cannot 
access the source of fire due to the damage of building and very high temperature, or even due to 
the presence of explosive materials. With such constraints and high risk in the handling of the fire, 
a technological breakthrough that can help fighting the fire is necessary. This project seeks to 
provide a technical solution for fire extinguishment in a hazardous setting. The robot has a robust 
fire extinguishing system and is designed to survive harsh environments. We wish to control the 
robot's motions and operations from a safe distance using the remote control interface, which offers 
firefighters with real-time control over the robot. A water tank with a pump is mounted to the robot 
to extinguish fires in buildings, industries, and other areas where fires have spread. A WIFI camera 
is installed in the robot to monitor the movement of the fire extinguisher robot, Through this we 
can move the robot front and back using the video which is transmitted through WIFI . This robot 
is controlled via a smartphone application, and it is linked to a bluetooth module. The application 
is linked to the bluetooth module, and the signal is sent to the arduino via the bluetooth module. 
The robot can move in response to the signal sent to the motor driver. Accuracy of the control 
system has been satisfactory throughout this project. The fire eliminating performance and the 
robot movement speed was closed to the aspiration
