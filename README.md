The automatic ticketing and fare calculation system for metro stations revolutionizes urban 
transportation management by seamlessly integrating RFID technology, Arduino 
microcontrollers, servo motors, and an LCD display with an I2C module. This innovative project 
aims to streamline ticketing processes, enhance commuter experience, and ensure accurate fare 
calculation within metro station environments. Commuters are provided RFID cards linked to 
their accounts, enabling them to access the metro station effortlessly. Upon approaching the entry 
gate, commuters scan their RFID cards, initiating a series of automated processes. The system 
verifies the card's authenticity using RFID technology and triggers the servo motor to open the 
gate, allowing commuters to enter seamlessly. Real-time feedback provided by the LCD display 
confirms card detection and gate opening, enhancing user experience. Inside the station, 
commuters proceed to their destinations while their entry points are recorded for journey 
tracking. Upon reaching the exit gate, commuters scan their RFID cards again to conclude their 
journey. The system calculates the fare based on entry and exit points, displaying the amount on 
the LCD display. Fare calculation is automated and accurate, ensuring transparency and 
efficiency. Central to the system's operation is the Arduino microcontroller, which orchestrates 
the integration of components. The microcontroller processes inputs from the RFID reader, 
controls the servo motor for gate operation, performs fare calculations, and communicates 
essential information to commuters via the LCD display. This centralized control ensures smooth 
operation and reliability. Advantages of the system include streamlined ticketing processes, 
reduced queues, and enhanced passenger flow management. Accurate fare calculation and 
transparent revenue management are facilitated through RFID technology and automated 
processes. Commuters benefit from a seamless and user-friendly experience, while safety and 
security are enhanced within the metro station premises, robot movement speed was closed to the
